# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Lizard-Spock 

Hey there!! :wave: 

This is our same good old game Rock-Paper-Scissor with a little addition. :smiley:	

Here, we also have lizard and spock along with the other three. Hence the 5 options.

## Rules

* You can enter any one of the 5 choices (one at a time) ~ Rock :rock:, Paper :page_facing_up:, Scissor :scissors:, Lizard :lizard:, Spock :vulcan_salute:.
* These options work as follows:

   - Rock:    ✔️ (Scissor, Lizard)    ;  :x: (Paper, Spock)      
   - Paper:   ✔️ (Rock, Spock)    ;      :x: (Scissor, Lizard)
   - Scissor: ✔️ (Paper, Lizard)    ;    :x: (Rock, Spock)
   - Lizard:  ✔️ (Paper, Spock)    ;     :x: (Rock, Scissor)
   - Spock:   ✔️ (Scissor, Rock)    ;    :x: (Paper, Lizard)
 
     Eg. Rock can defeat scissor & lizard but loses against paper & spock.
   - It will be a tie if both the opponents chose same option.
 
* You will enter your choice first and then the computer will play its turn.
* Play as many rounds as you want.
  
### Scoring 
* 1 point will be given for winning a round & 0 if you lose or if it's a tie.
* Final scores along with the winner will be declared in the end i.e., when you decide not to play anymore rounds.
